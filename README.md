# Analyzing the UK's Economic Trends

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the economic trends of the United Kingdom using monthly GDP data. It involves various tasks such as data import, visualization, aggregation, and analysis of recession periods. By examining these aspects, we aim to gain insights into the UK's economic performance over time.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Import for UK Economic Analysis

In this task, we import monthly GDP data for the UK from the 'UK_monthly_gdp.csv' file. This step is crucial as it provides the foundational data necessary for our analysis.

### Task 2: Visualizing UK's GDP Growth

This task involves creating a heatmap to visualize the UK's GDP growth over time. By representing the data visually, we aim to identify trends and patterns in GDP growth, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the UK's economic performance.

### Task 3: Aggregating Quarterly Data

Here, we aggregate the monthly GDP data into quarterly averages. This aggregated data provides a more manageable and meaningful representation of economic trends, making it easier to analyze and uncover insights into the UK's economic performance.

### Task 4: Analyzing Recession Periods

In this task, we identify and visualize recession periods by tracking GDP growth over time. By pinpointing when GDP growth falls below zero for two consecutive quarters, we can detect recessionary periods and understand their impact on the UK's economy.

### Task 5: Analyzing Recession Duration and Severity

Finally, we examine the duration and severity of recession periods to gain a deeper understanding of their impact on the UK's economy. By aggregating data on recession periods, we can assess the intensity of economic downturns and their implications.
